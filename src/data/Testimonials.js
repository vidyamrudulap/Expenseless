This app helps you keep track of balance, outlook, cash-flow, spending, credit, budget, goals, planned payments, debts, shopping lists, warranties, loyalty cards, and currency rates.

        testimonial: "So far, so good. First, I wanted a VERY simple, secure, free app to track small business income in categories, with templates for common transactions. Second, a quick way to record cash purchases. This looks safe and straightforward. It was easy to create and use templates. I only want bare bones, so what I love so far is Wallet is LETTING ME take out all the extras.",

Prices for the Business are reasonable too.  I'm glad that I stumbled across this app, it's versatility and smoothness is top tier!  Without a doubt, the best one! Recommended!",

        testimonial: "Fantastic app to record and keep track of expenses. I don't use the auto-sync function since I need to manually edit some incoming credits. There is way to keep track of goals, monthly & one time budget, transfer function, reminders and so much. The charts are useful in visualising the expenses and the export function is useful when I want to check out and do more with the entries.",

        testimonial: "I absolutely love this app. The level of granularity that you can view your statistics and customize your charts is so useful. I use the template maker so often and you can customize your categories and add labels to every record, and then filter based on all of the criteria, which is absolutely wonderful. On the web app you also can't add templates and labels! I will definitely keep using this!",
